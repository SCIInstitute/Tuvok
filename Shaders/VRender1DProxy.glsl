/**
  \brief Proxy function to provide a unified interface over the VRender
         functions.

  'VRender1D' takes different parameters depending on whether or not we are
  using the 'bias + scale' version or the version that assumes ranges based on
  bit widths.  This version calls the appropriate one based on a runtime
  setting.
