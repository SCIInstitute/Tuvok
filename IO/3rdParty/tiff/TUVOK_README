This is a special version of libtiff.  The original version is
available from:

  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff

This distribution is missing critical files required to use libtiff.
It is meant only for use with the Tuvok volume rendering library.
Tuvok and libtiff are distributed under different but compatible
licenses.  If you want to use libtiff in your own projects, this is not
the source you should use: see the above link.

Please report issues with this library to the Tuvok developers; do NOT
report problems to the libtiff developers!
