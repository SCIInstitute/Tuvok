 \class SBVRGeogen2D
 \brief Geometry generation for 2D texture based the slice-based 
 volume renderer. 
 
 This class implements 3 different algorithms to generate the object aligned
 geometry for a 2D texture slice-based volume renderer. Those three methods
 are Christoph Resz's "traditional" stack switching method, where the one 
 stack three object aligned stacks is chosen for rendering that is most
 perpendicular to the viewing direction (i.e. the normal to viewing direction
 dot product is minimal). The other two approaches are the naive slow and the 
 optimized fast implementation of Jens Krueger's new sampling scheme for slice
 based volume rendering. Which of the three methods is used can be controlled
 by setting m_eMethod.
